好久没来博客看看了，又荒废了一年，北欧的冬季抑郁真是名不虚传。又或许只是我个人逃避现实的一个借口。最近又深感不能如此颓废，人生怎么活得那么纠结，虽然最近玩桌游倒是不亦悦乎。操心操心毕业的事情吧，真是过得太安逸了，少说多做啊！于是乎又来这里自残了。

这是在学校一个关于computer pioneers的seminar下的presentation，而之前心里对于要说20分钟以上的英文其实还是有点害怕的。所以就写了一个演讲稿，当天就厚脸皮边读边说边假装做个样子了……不过主要还是不够自信吧，多做几次应该会好很多。英语对于我而言，还是个大坑。

发在这里纯当纪念，希望多年后的我再回来看到这个的时候，心里想的是不就20多分钟的presentation，还需要写个稿子？

参考资料基本上都是他的[维基](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)和[个人网站](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/)里都能找到。

Hello, everyone. My name is XXX and today, I'm going to talk about a famous computer scientist and cognitive scientist at the twentieth century, namely John McCarthy. When speaking of him, most of people only know he is the farther of artificial intelligence. Yes,the contributions of McCarthy are mainly in AI, but his achievements was much more than that. So let's begin.

##personal life##

John McCarthy was born in a immigrant family at Boston, Massachusetts|mæsəˈtʃuːsɪts|, on September 1927. His father, John Patrick McCarthy was an Irish|ˈaɪərɪʃ| Catholic|ˈkæθəlɪk| and worked as a carpenter, a fisherman, and an union organizer. His mother, Ida Glatt-McCarthy was an Lithuanian|ˌlɪθjuːˈeɪnɪən| Jewish|ˈdʒuːɪʃ| and worked as a journalist|ˈdʒɜːnəlɪst|, also a social worker who was active in woman suffrage|ˈsʌfrɪdʒ| movements. Both parents were active members of the US Communist|ˈkɒmjʊnɪst| Party during the 1930s. 

When the Great Depression started in the beginning of 1930s, his family had to move many times, finally setting down in Los Angeles, that is partially because of McCarthy’s illness.

Growing in a family with Communist parents, he became interested in the Soviet|ˈsəʊvɪət| Union and made several visits to the Soviet Union in his whole life. He learned Russian and having friendships with several computer scientists in Russia. By doing that, he gradually developed Communist ideas. McCarthy married three times and his second wife helped persuaded him to become a conservative Republican.
He also said he is an atheist|ˈeɪθɪɪst|(which means someone doesn't believe in God).

John McCarthy died at his home in Stanford at 84 years old on 2011 with a heart attack. 

##education and career##
McCarthy showed genius at a young age. he started school late for a year because he was a sickly child but still abled to skip several grades. After his family moved to Los Angeles for his health, he taught himself college calculus and graduated from Belmont High School two years early. Then He entered California Institute of Technology in 1944. 

McCarthy was reportedly forced to leave from Caltech school  for failure to attend physical education courses. Then he served in the US Army and was readmitted to Caltech, receiving a Bachelor degree in Mathematics in 1948. 

McCarthy met John von Neumann on a lecture at Caltech. Neumann inspired McCarthy for his future endeavors|ɪnˈdevə(r)| which is developing machines that could think like people do. McCarthy thought Princeton University was the best place for studying mathematics where has the 'subject he wanted to devote.

So after graduted one year from Caltech, he enrolled at Princeton University for further Ph.D. study In mathematics. In 1949, McCarthy made his first attempt to model human intelligence on a machine.

He received a Ph.D. at Princeton University in 1951. And then as a Instructor in mathematics, He taught at Caltech until 1953. After that he taught mathematics at several universities, finally returned to Stanford University in 1958 and became a full professor in 1962.

John McCarthy nominally|ˈnɒmɪnəli| retired at the end of 2000 and he was awarded Professor Emeritus|ɪˈmerɪtəs| of Computer Science at Stanford University.

##coined the term "AI"

After a long time of preparation, The Dartmouth Conference in 1956 was held. There were four organizers including John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and two senior scientists: Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester of IBM. You can see from the picture, there were lots of people attending the conference. In fact, I have tried to find McCarthy from the picture, but I failed.

McCarthy created the term "Artificial Intelligence" as the name of the field and it was widely accepted both by people working in the field and the general public after the conference. 

As McCarthy said in his oral history, "I had to call it something, so I called it ‘Artificial Intelligence’ and I had a vague feeling that I have heard the phrase before, but in all these years I have never been able to track it down." 

Scientists from different fields**(mathematics, psychology, engineering, economics and political science)** began to discuss the possibility of creating an artificial brain. 
The participants included **(Ray Solomonoff, Oliver Selfridge, Trenchard More, Arthur Samuel, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon)** so many guys and I'm not going to talk all of them, but I have to say they had created important programs or made contributions during the first decades of AI research. 

The proposal for the conference included this assertion: "every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it." 

But actually, the conference didn't solve any real problems at that time, it only defined artificial intelligence as a discipline and a seperate field of study within computer science. 

Although there was someone written some papers earlier about the machine intelligence. The conference is generally considered as a serious beginning of the ‘Artificial Intelligence’ industry.

After almost forty years, according to a bio'graphy, When McCarthy looking back this conference, he knew creating a truly intelligent machine is enormously difficult at that period. And he said:

"The goals that I had for that conference were entirely unrealistic. I thought that major projects could be undertaken during the course of a summer conference. The model was actually something that I had never attended but had heard of–a military summer conference on air defense."

I think he was right. he had no idea about how difficult the challenge of building a intelligence machines was in 1956. Designing a computer with the intelligence and common sense of a human is still not possible nowadays. But he believed the breakthrough might come after 5 to 500 years.

##history of Lisp##

Lisp is the standard programming language used not only in robotics|rəʊˈbɒtɪks| and other scientific applications but also in many Internet-based services, from credit-card fraud|frɔːd| detection|dɪˈtekʃn| to airline scheduling. McCarthy also used Lisp to write one of the earliest computer chess programs to against other chess programs from Soviet Union. 

"LISP I is a programming system for the IBM 704 for computing with symbolic expressions. It has been used for symbolic calculations in differential and integral|ˈɪntɪgrəl| calculus, electric circuit|ˈsɜːkɪt| theory, mathematical logic, and artificial intelligence."

McCarthy created Lisp in 1958. The name "Lisp" came from "list processor|ˈprəʊsesə(r)|". Besides recursion, programs written in LISP could process arbitrary symbolic structures and could treat programs (written in LISP) as data which expressed as lists in LISP. McCarthy said he got the idea of list processing from the Dartmouth conference in 1956, but he didn't like the language they were using(IPL), so he decided to make a new one that is Lisp. 

Comparing LISP to a universal Turing machine, McCarthy claimed|kleɪm| that LISP was much more transparent in structure. LISP soon became the language of choice for AI research at that time. Programs written in LISP were used in a NASA spacecraft and are key parts of several practical AI systems. Because of its suitability|ˌsuːtəˈbɪləti| to complex and dynamic applications, Lisp is currently enjoying some re'surgence of popular 'interest and became the second oldest programming language in 'present 'widespread use(by the way, the most oldest language is Fortran)

Around 1959, he came up with a tech'nique called "garbage collection". In computer science, garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management. The garbage collector is to find data objects in a program that cannot be accessed|ˈæksesd| in the future, or try to reclaim memory occupied by 'objects that are no longer in use by the program. This technique is to 'abstract away manual memory management in Lisp. Many programming languages require garbage collection. for example, Java, C#, Go have made garbage collection as part of the language specification. C and C++ used both manual memory management and garbage collection technique. Like other memory management techniques, garbage collection may take a significant proportion of total processing time in a program and, as a result, garbage collection can have significant influence on performance.

##time sharing##

In 1957 and 1958 at MIT, McCarthy made the first project to implement a timesharing system—-which allowing a single computer to be simultaneously|ˌsɪmlˈteɪnɪəsli| shared among several users, or we say, allowing many people to share data by linking to a central computer.

By allowing a large number of users to inte'ract in the same time with a single computer, time-sharing dramatically lowered the cost of providing computing capability|ˌkeɪpəˈbɪləti|, made it possible for individuals and organizations to use a computer without owning one.

Although computers ultimately|ˈʌltɪmətli| became sufficiently inex'pensive that most people did not have to share computers, timesharing technology is still used to allow several programs of a single user to be simultaneously active.

Lester Earnest, a retired Stanford senior research scientist who designed the first computer spell-checker, said that.

“The Internet would not have happened nearly as soon as it did, ex'cept for the fact that John initiated the development of time-sharing systems. We keep inventing new names for time-sharing. It came to be called servers. Now we call it cloud computing. That is still just timesharing. John started it.”

##circumscription##

As for circumscription, I would like to say it's quite hard to understand what McCarthy was doing and what circumscription is. Because I believe it contains some philosophical|fɪləˈsɒfɪcal| thinkings. But I have to say it's a very very important contribution for artificial Intelligence by John McCarthy

From 1978 to 1986, McCarthy developed the circumscription method of non monotonic[mɒnə'tɒnɪk] reasoning. So what is non monotonic? First, let me explain what is monotonic. Monotonic means, new facts can only add to early
conclusions and not to conflict with them. 

And as for non-monotonic, it means new facts can change the conclusions. For example, If we know there is a bird, we conclude it can fly. But if we find out this bird is actually a penguin|ˈpeŋgwɪn|, then we conclude it cannot fly.

**翻页**

So what is circumscription? lets look at this sentence, which I took from his article. To be honest, I still don't get it now. I was very confused when I read the article. So I'm going to skip this part.

By the way, there are about ten different versions of circumscription on the AI market today.


##main awards and honors##

As you can see from the slides, John McCarthy have earned many awards and honors by what he has done. I'm not going to go through them. So if you are interested in his awards and why he got those awards, you can just find them online.

##McCarthy's favorite aphorism##

McCarthy believed mathematics and mathematics education is very important. This aphorism|ˈæfərɪzəm| was attached at his license plate. “Do the arithmetic|əˈrɪθmətɪk| or be doomed to talk nonsense.” I do believe him because I am studying in computer science and I know the importance of math.
